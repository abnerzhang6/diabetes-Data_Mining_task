# Diabetes Data Mining Task

Dataset from Kaggle.

## About Dataset

The Diabetes prediction dataset is a collection of medical and demographic data from patients, along with their diabetes status (positive or negative). The data includes features such as age, gender, body mass index (BMI), hypertension, heart disease, smoking history, HbA1c level, and blood glucose level. This dataset can be used to build machine learning models to predict diabetes in patients based on their medical history and demographic information. This can be useful for healthcare professionals in identifying patients who may be at risk of developing diabetes and in developing personalized treatment plans. Additionally, the dataset can be used by researchers to explore the relationships between various medical and demographic factors and the likelihood of developing diabetes.

## Methodology

This project makes full use of the sklearn package to implement algorithms such as knn, logistic regression, naive bayes, decision trees, random forests, SVM, and Adaboost. The complete process from data has been processed, cross-validation, model training, model evaluation, model comparison, etc. is fully realized.
